cae2c1b9-2144-4c80-85e4-33765e8f0519,Terrible company. I had Netflix for a long time but decided to change to a couple different platforms now and then this year.

368d3bd5-2c9d-412c-9cd0-56e993044608,Netflix has been trying to follow Tubi's model which is a horrible idea. Tubi's great because it's free. It has a lot of not-so-great series but it's free so that's the tradeoff. Netflix charges a lot of money yet uploads almost the same quality if not worse than Tubi.,3

I have gotten to where I don't want to watch anything on it anymore unless it has 2-3 seasons out. The latest price increase also is unjustifiable. I am actively working toward pushing the house to other options to get rid of Netflix. It isnt worth it anymore and Netflix needs to change.,1

You have to clear cache and storage and reboot the phone before opening the app twice to get it to work. It won't stay open in the background with inactivity so if you use this app a lot like me it's really not working!! Netflix two weeks on still has no support. (Price has more than doubled yet can't use! Not good netflix!!),1

With over 1 billion members and a share price over $1000 per share I'm disappointed that it's come to this.

c528c5e1-392d-4acb-bd3b-696c89489351,"The service works fine, neither better nor worse than its major competitors like Disney+ or Amazon Prime. One thing I do like about it is that it has the English dubbed versions of anime, whereas Crunchyroll frequently only has the subtitled versions. One thing I DON'T like is that it makes skipping credits the default and only gives you a few seconds to click the button to see the credits before automatically switching to the next episode, which annoys me. The default should be click to skip.",4

74ea00a1-8001-48cf-8f70-ba4d8be794f0,Why are we PAYING to watch ads? What a joke? I am now being forced off my $12.99 plan to the AD plan that I DO NOT want however I absolutely refuse to pay the rediculious premium prices. Netflix used to be good but they have just become so disgustingly GREEDY! I am so unbelievably disappointed! What was wrong with the $12.99 plan? If I wanted to watch adds I'd watch free to air. They have ads so they can provide a FREE service. Netflix is a paid service so shouldn't have ads at all. Just GREEDY!,1

Are these arrivals new content or from several decades ago? Netflix's own content is poorly rated garbage (Seven Samurai set in Space as an example). It struggles with 720p, how's it going to handle 1020p? The free to air offerings here outstrip the cheap flops you push at me. Simply not worth the price.",1

Absolutely ridiculous if you cannot use it while travelling because you don't speak english or the country language which is the case for our grandparent that mostly use Netflix.

I am certain that noone could have gotten into my account using the password. This means Netflix's privacy & security protocols are very very poor. Additionally Netflix does not let you close one account and open a fresh one. It will only let you cancel the subscription which means one has to go back and use the same hacked account again. I am absolutely done with this app.,1

Shameless is literally the ONLY good thing on Netflix now. The rest of the movies or shows are just weird, inappropiate, or just terrible. Hulu is definitely better. And every other streaming service out there. I'd rather use Tubi than Netflix atp.",1
